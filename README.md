# Blog Client

This project is a React-based blog client application built with Vite. It includes essential features such as JWT-based authentication, routing, and a clean component structure. It was built to showcase the [Blog API](https://github.com/sourdoughbredd/blog-api).

## Description

The Blog Client is designed to provide a seamless and efficient user experience for browsing and interacting with the [Blog API](https://github.com/sourdoughbredd/blog-api). It uses React for the frontend framework, Vite for the development environment, and incorporates various modern web development practices. Note that since this was only developed to showcase the [Blog API](https://github.com/sourdoughbredd/blog-api), it isn't the prettiest and may have some UI bugs.
